i see trees of green red roses to
i see them bloom for me and you
and i think to myself what a wonderful world
the colours of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
are also in the faces of people going by
i see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
they are really saying i love you
i hear babies cry i watch them grow
they will learn much more and ill never know
and i think to myself what a wonderful world
