# OOP-assigment

I used 3 classes for the entire project.
Main class: This is where i called the classed which i want to be runned.

Menu class: This is the class associated with the cover page. Its the page users see when they run the program.

SearchFile class: This is where most of the programming was done. This class allows users to search for a file on a new window and display the files.


I added a Text field which collects users inputs and process them to give required output. I added buttons and action listener to perform tasks as required.Added a text field which displays outputs as needed. When the user press search, the word eneter is passed into a function which performs the following task.I put each files in a folder and went through each folder to find the word the user entered. When the wound is found, i increment a variable and at the end, the variable is sorted in ascending order of which files has the most occurances.

I added show all the file option and also added a button which allows users to make and add more files. I did this by getting in the word the users entered and adding
".txt". which converts it into a file. i then made a file with the name the users inouted and added this to the folder. After this, i made a function which goes through each file and displays it to the textarea.

If i had more time, i would have added a way in which users can write to the file they created. 
Also add in a way in which users can delete files they no longer need. 
Also add in a way on which users can know more about each of the file if needed.
